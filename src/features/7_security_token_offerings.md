## Feature 7: Crowdfunding and Security Token Offerings

The digital free zone introduces a dynamic and innovative approach to crowdfunding and security token offerings, providing an alternative to traditional and often expensive methods. 

Here's a breakdown of this feature:

1. **Digital Asset Offering Ability**:
   * Companies within the free zone can create digital asset offerings, including securities, shares, or other digital securities.
   * These offerings are tracked on the free zone's blockchain system, ensuring transparency and authenticity.

2. **Accessibility and Cost-Effectiveness**:
   * Unlike traditional public offerings in places like Switzerland, Luxembourg, or New York, which can be costly and limited, the digital free zone offers an affordable and streamlined process.
   * Traditional security offerings can cost between $300,000 and $500,000 with annual expenses in the hundreds of thousands or even millions. In the free zone, these costs are dramatically reduced.

3. **Security and Authenticity Requirements**:
   * Each security offering undergoes rigorous screening, including ownership of assets and background checks.
   * This transparent mechanism offers protection for subscribers, ensuring that the assets are genuine and not fraudulent.

4. **Personal Free Zone Accounts**:
   * While buyers and suppliers of a security offering need to be in the free zone, Personal Accounts provide a flexible solution.
   * Costing only $10 a month, Personal Accounts allow participation in token offerings without all the advanced features.
   * These accounts enable potentially hundreds of millions of people to join the free zone at a low cost.

5. **Crowdfunding Capabilities**:
   * Companies within the digital free zone can organize crowdfundings among members.
   * Thousands of people can co-own a company through digital shares, with the ability to sell, organize, and define the shares.
   * A digital shareholders agreement ensures that everyone can see the terms, and an internal dispute resolution mechanism swiftly resolves conflicts.

6. **Innovation and Potential**:
   * The free zone's approach to crowdfunding and security token offerings revolutionizes how companies can raise capital, collaborate, and grow.
   * By removing traditional barriers and leveraging blockchain technology, the free zone fosters a transparent, secure, and accessible environment for all.

In summary, the digital free zone's feature of crowdfunding and security token offerings provides a groundbreaking alternative to conventional methods. Through digital asset offerings, secure and transparent mechanisms, affordable Personal Accounts, and innovative crowdfunding capabilities, it facilitates broader participation and unleashes new opportunities for companies and investors alike.
