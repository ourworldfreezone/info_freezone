## Feature 1: Dispute Resolution

The digital free zone offers a structured and efficient mechanism for resolving disputes, ensuring that conflicts can be addressed quickly and fairly. The process unfolds through a multi-stage approach:

1. **Digital Approach**: Initially, disputes are handled digitally using smart contracts, involving independent third parties to mediate and help resolve the issue. This stage can be quite rapid.

2. **Legal Council**: If the digital approach doesn't resolve the matter, the case is taken to the legal council within the digital free zone. These appointed lawyers, experts in dispute resolution, will suggest solutions to the involved parties. Typically, this stage can take up to a week.

3. **International Court**: As a last resort, if no agreement is reached through the earlier stages, the dispute may be taken to an international court, such as the International Court of Paris.

The unique feature of this dispute resolution process is its efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Settlements can be reached in days rather than years, and at a fraction of the usual cost, facilitating smoother business operations within the free zone.
