## Feature 3: Free Zone Directory

The Digital Free Zone introduces an integrated Free Zone Directory, enhancing connectivity and commerce within the community. 

[NAMING CONVENTION:  Do we want to use "Free Zone" or or "FreeZone"?  We need to choose one and be consistent.  Same goes for capitalization -- it should be consistent]

   * Every digital free zone company is provided access to the Director to publish their services and products, creating visibility across the Free Zone.
   * Showcase your expertise, products, or solutions to an targeted audience that shares the principles and values of OurWorld Zanzibar.

3. **Integrated Payments**:
   * All transactions within the directory are seamlessly integrated within the Free Zone's financial infrastructure.

4. **Building a Community**:
