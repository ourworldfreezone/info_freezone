## Feature 10: Integrated Business Management (IBM) Tools

The digital free zone further enhances convenience and efficiency with an integrated business management and tax reporting tool, providing a robust solution for your Free Zone company. 

Here's a breakdown of what this feature offers:

1. **Effortless On-Boarding**:
   * You and your Company can be onboarded (including KYC/AML+)in a matter of days; compliance is ongoing, automatic.  Free Zone security, respectability and compliance are of fundamental importance to Free Zone operations
   * Companies have immediate access to the Free Zone's IBM Tools wh.

2. **Fully-Automated Back Office**:
   * System automatically handles all Company bookkeping, prepares financial reports (e.g. P&L, Revenue, Expenses), and prepare any necessary tax documents - all in accordance with generally accepted, international standards. 
   * System also integrates invoicing, payroll and other business functions which can all be automated in the Free Zone.

3. **Automated Tax Reporting**:
   * Automatic tax reporting and payment to tax authorities in Zanzibar, in order to streamline your financial obligations.
   * Compliance is ensured without the hassle of manual engagement, saving valuable time and resources.

[NB:  Why aren't we automatically deducting Tax Payment to ZRB?  We don't want a situation where someone opts out, then they have to be chased to pay their taxes to ZRB.  That puts us in a difficult place - on a number of levels.  ZRB 5% payment should be automatic; this is part of the Free Zone Social Contract.] My strong preference is to use langauge as I've re-drafted it, and confirm that this will be our policy.

4. **Simplified Business Operations**:
   * This digital tool is designed to make your business life more straightforward and efficient, offering a cohesive solution for various aspects of business management.
