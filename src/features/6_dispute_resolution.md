## Feature 6: Dispute Resolution

The digital free zone offers a structured and efficient mechanism for resolving disputes, ensuring that conflicts can be addressed quickly and fairly. The process unfolds through a multi-stage approach:

1. **Digital Approach**: Initially, disputes are handled based on the digital record of the parties' business releationship, including any digital agreements.  Independent third-parties may be utilized for mediation purposes as appropriate.  Most disputes can be resolved at this stage, whcih can be quie rapid. 

2. **Legal Council**: If the initial, digital approach doesn't resolve the dispute, either party can submit the dispute to a legal body within the Free Zone which will have the authority to issue a decision that binds the parties and, as appropriate, prescribes the means of enforcement.  This stage relies on innovative decision-making and burden-sharing features to encourage accuracy and speed in dispute resolution.
   
4. **International Court**: As a last resort, if no agreement is reached through the earlier stages, the dispute may be taken to an international court, such as the International Court of Paris.

[Delete Number 4.  There's no international court that a case can be taken to without the parties acceding to the jurisdiction of a particular tribunal under an agreed set of rules.  I would suggest that the dispute ends with the Legal Council, but I want to give it some thought.  If there's a concern about enforcing a judgment of the Legal Counci, there are some interesting ways to do that which don't require another tribunal]

The unique feature of this dispute resolution process is its efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Settlements can be reached in days rather than years, and at a fraction of the usual cost, facilitating smoother business operations within the free zone.
