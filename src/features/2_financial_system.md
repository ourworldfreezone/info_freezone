## FEATURE 2: Integrated Financial System

The Digital Free Zone offers an all-encompassing and innovative financial system that integrates various connectors to facilitate smooth transactions and asset management. 

Here's an in-depth look at its structure:

1. **Gold Treasury**:
   * Each member has a gold weight account connected to the Gold Treasury, allowing for money to be held in the form of physical gold.
   * Operated by a regulated gold supplier in Denmark, with more partners to come.
   * The gold weight account functions like a traditional bank account but can hold physical gold, and has an IBAN number for global transfers.
   * You can transfer money from your own bank account to your gold weight account but cannot send it to a third-party IBAN bank account.
   * Transactions within the FreeZone from weight account to weight account are unlimited and cost-free, essentially transferring physical gold.
   * All transactions are securely registered on the blockchain.

2. **Debit Cards**:
   * Members can add a debit card to their gold weight account for easy access and spending.

3. **Digital Currencies and Assets**:
   * The system is compatible with digital currencies like Bitcoin and other digital assets.
   * Transfers in and out of the Digital Free Zone can be done legally and compliantly using these digital currencies.

4. **Global Exchanges**:
   * Members can link their exchange accounts (e.g., Kraken) to their Digital Free Zone company.
   * More exchanges and connectors with digital banks are in development, expected in Q2 2024.

This integrated financial system offers ultimate flexibility and security for Free Zone members. Whether handling physical gold, using digital currencies, or operating with global exchanges, members have a diverse and modern set of tools at their disposal. Transactions within this system are seamless, promoting efficient business practices within the Free Zone.
