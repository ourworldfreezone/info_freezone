### Company Type 1: Personal Company (PC)

The Personal Company serves as an entry-level option within the digital free zone, tailored for individual owners who desire to engage and collaborate within the community but may not need the full range of features offered to Tanzanite Companies. Ideal for those looking to explore the offerings of the free zone, the Personal Company provides essential capabilities:

- **Holding Money and Digital Assets:** Owners can securely hold various forms of currency, including digital assets.
- **Owning Assets:** Provides the ability to hold physical and digital properties.
- **Sending and Receiving Money:** Enables seamless transactions both within the free zone and with external parties.
- **Signing Contracts:** Personal Companies have the authority to enter into legally binding agreements.
- **Managing Contracts:** Oversee all contractual obligations, alterations, and fulfillment.
- **Collaboration:** Facilitates working relationships with other free zone members and outside entities.
- **Global Transactions:** Accepting and dispatching funds to and from international sources.
- **Voting Rights:** Participate in the decision-making processes for one of the companies within the free zone.
- **Participation in Security Token Offerings:** Engage in investment opportunities within the free zone through security token offerings.

This tier of membership within the free zone offers a substantial array of features, making it suitable for a wide variety of individuals and small-scale collaborators, without the commitment required for a Tanzanite Company.
