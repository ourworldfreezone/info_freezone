### Company Type 3: Global Business Company (GBC)

The Global Business Company (GBC) within the digital free zone is designed to cater to multi-shareholder businesses with a global reach. Unlike the more individual-focused company types like the Personal Company or Tanzanite Company, GBCs are built for extensive global business operations. Here's an overview of the features and attributes of a GBC:

- **Global Business Operations:** A GBC can conduct business across jurisdictions and locations without any geographical restrictions.
- **Attractive Tax Benefits:** GBCs enjoy low corporate tax rates, potentially as low as 5%, along with tax exemptions and other fiscal incentives to encourage investment.
- **Local Director Requirements:** GBCs must have at least 3 resident directors within the digital free zone, allowing for strong local governance, while shareholders and beneficial owners can be from foreign countries.

[NB:  What is "resident" in the digital free zone?  Do you mean on the actual land that we will be given to operate the free zone?  If yes, then aren't we creating a coterie of resident Directors who sit on the Boards or every GBC?  This has worked really badly in South Africa -- where you have professional BEE Directors who do nothing but earn fees for sitting on Boards that require Black directors]

- **Flexible Uses:** The structure of a GBC is suitable for various purposes, such as global asset holding, international trade, investment platforms, and tax optimization structures.
- **Regulation and Compliance:** GBCs fall under the jurisdiction of the digital free zone financial commission and must adhere to specific rules on accounting, reporting, and other regulatory requirements. This ensures transparency and accountability.

[NB:  What is "the digital free zone financial commission"?  We're still in the process of developing OWZ / ZdfZ structure; this is going to be part of a larger exercise]
  
- **Creation by Personal Companies:** A GBC can be established only by one or more Personal (PC) or Tanzanite Companies (TCs) acting as shareholders, ensuring that the creation process is managed by entities with comprehensive capabilities within the free zone.

The GBC structure offers a powerful and versatile platform for businesses looking to expand their reach and operate on a global scale. With the benefits of favorable tax treatment, broad operational flexibility, and a supportive regulatory environment, GBCs stand as an attractive option for ambitious companies aiming to leverage the unique features of the digital free zone for worldwide business endeavors.
