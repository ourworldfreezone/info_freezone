### Company Type 3: Global Business Company (GBC)

The Global Business Company (GBC) within the Digital Free Zone is designed to cater to multi-shareholder businesses with a global reach. Unlike the more individual-focused company types like the Guest Company and Personal Company, GBCs are built for extensive global business operations. Here's an overview of the features and attributes of a GBC:

- **Global Business Operations:** A GBC can conduct business across jurisdictions and locations without any geographical restrictions.
- **Attractive Tax Benefits:** GBCs enjoy low corporate tax rates, potentially as low as 5%, along with tax exemptions and other fiscal incentives to encourage investment.
- **Local Director Requirements:** GBCs must have at least 3 resident directors within the Digital Freezone, allowing for strong local governance, while shareholders and beneficial owners can be from foreign countries.
- **Flexible Uses:** The structure of a GBC is suitable for various purposes, such as global asset holding, international trade, investment platforms, and tax optimization structures.
- **Commonwealth Advantage:** Being part of the commonwealth, GBCs are appealing for cross-border business, facilitating trade and investment between commonwealth countries.
- **Regulation and Compliance:** GBCs fall under the jurisdiction of the Digital Freezone Financial Commission and must adhere to specific rules on accounting, reporting, and other regulatory requirements. This ensures transparency and accountability.
- **Creation by Personal Companies:** A GBC can be established only by one or more Personal Companies (PCs) acting as shareholders, ensuring that the creation process is managed by entities with comprehensive capabilities within the Freezone.

The GBC structure offers a powerful and versatile platform for businesses looking to expand their reach and operate on a global scale. With the benefits of favorable tax treatment, broad operational flexibility, and a supportive regulatory environment, GBCs stand as an attractive option for ambitious companies aiming to leverage the unique features of the Digital Free Zone for worldwide business endeavors.
