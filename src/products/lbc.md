### Company Type 4: Local Business Company (LBC)

The Local Business Company (LBC) within the Digital Free Zone is tailored to facilitate business exclusively within the Freezone. Unlike the Global Business Company (GBC), which has the flexibility to conduct business globally, LBCs are restricted to operations solely within the confines of the Digital Free Zone. 

The LBC structure provides a platform for businesses aiming to thrive within the Digital Free Zone's unique environment. By concentrating on the local Freezone market and benefiting from the specific features and support systems of the Freezone, LBCs can build strong local networks and contribute to the growth and dynamism of the Freezone community.


Here's an overview of the features and attributes of an LBC:

- **Local Business Operations:** An LBC is designed to conduct business strictly within the Digital Freezone. All parties involved in transactions or collaborations with the LBC must be part of the Freezone.
- **Exclusive Freezone Benefits:** LBCs can take advantage of the unique benefits offered by the Freezone, such as tax efficiency, integrated business management tools, digital signatures, and more.
- **Limited Geographical Reach:** Unlike GBCs, LBCs cannot extend their business operations outside of the Freezone, making them ideal for entrepreneurs and businesses focused on serving the local Freezone community.
- **Compliance with Freezone Regulations:** LBCs must comply with specific rules, regulations, and guidelines set forth by the Digital Freezone authorities. This ensures that the operations align with the Freezone's objectives and standards.
- **Creation by Personal Companies or Guest Companies:** An LBC can be established by one or more Personal Companies (PCs) or Guest Companies (GCs) acting as shareholders, allowing for a simplified creation process.
- **Community Integration:** LBCs play a vital role in strengthening the internal business ecosystem within the Freezone, fostering collaboration, and promoting a sense of community among Freezone members.
- **Shareholding Structure:** Shareholders of an LBC or a Global Business Company (GBC) must always be through Personal Companies (PCs). Essentially, you own 100% of a Personal Company, which in turn owns the shares of the LBC or GBC.
- **Two-Step Approach:** This two-step approach involving a Personal Company owning shares in an LBC or GBC simplifies the process of dispute resolution and the overall business structure. It also facilitates the automation of creating a cohesive and thriving ecosystem inside the virtual country.
- **Clean Dispute Resolution:** By maintaining this structure, the process for resolving disputes becomes more streamlined and unambiguous, ensuring fair and swift outcomes.
- **Living Ecosystem:** The tiered structure contributes to a dynamic, interconnected community within the Free Zone, promoting collaboration, growth, and a robust business environment.

This system aims to harness the best of the Free Zone's features to build a virtual country that simplifies business processes, encourages collaboration, and maintains clear and transparent guidelines for all involved. It builds upon the familiar concept of free zones in other regions but refines it for the unique digital environment of "our zone."
