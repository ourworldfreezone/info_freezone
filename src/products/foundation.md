### Digital Foundation (DF)

A Digital Foundation is a special non-profit entity within the digital free zone, designed to act like a local or global business company. Here are the key characteristics and features of a Digital Foundation:

- **Non-Profit Structure:** Unlike typical business companies, a Digital Foundation operates on a non-profit basis. It can accumulate wealth and money, but these funds cannot be returned to its members or shareholders.
- **No Shareholders, Only Members:** Unlike other types of companies, a Digital Foundation doesn't have shareholders but consists of members. Any funds or wealth within the foundation remain within it and must be used solely for the benefit of the foundation itself.
- **Minimum Co-Ownership:** A foundation must always be co-owned by a minimum of five members. However, this ownership is unique in its non-profit nature, ensuring that no individual can forcibly extract money from the foundation, even if all five members were to agree.
- **Governance System:** The members use a digital governance system to manage the foundation's activities. This system enables them to reach consensus on various decisions, including funding activities, sending and receiving money, and other functions necessary for a non-profit foundation.
- **Restriction on Fund Distribution:** The structure of the Digital Foundation ensures that all accumulated money must be dedicated to the mission and objectives of the foundation itself. It cannot be distributed to members or any associated shareholders.
- **Flexibility in Governance:** Within the Our World Free Zone, each company, including Digital Foundations, can adopt a flexible digital governance system tailored to its unique needs and goals. This system is defined at the setup stage, allowing for a bespoke approach to decision-making and operations.

### Conclusion

Digital Foundations represent a novel and valuable addition to the types of companies available within the digital free zone. They blend the operational capabilities of a business company with the ethical commitment of a non-profit entity. 

This balance allows them to pursue ambitious goals without the profit-driven constraints of typical corporations. Moreover, the digital tools and flexible governance options ensure an efficient and transparent operation, aligning with the innovative spirit of the digital free zone.
