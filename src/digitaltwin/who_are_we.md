## We are value driven

> **Restore the commons through our self-sovereignity.**

- **PLANET FIRST**: 
  - Our planet is our home, and its well-being is paramount. Every action we take must prioritize its benefit and sustainability. Nothing we do can come at the expense of Mother Earth.
  - Restore the commons: see [http://restorethecommons.org](http://restorethecommons.org)
- **PEOPLE FIRST**: 
  - People and communities are at the heart of our existence. They are what we live for and value above all. Our focus on people ensures that our actions resonate with compassion, connection, and the shared goal of collective prosperity.
  - Every person needs to be sovereign and aware of their own power before its possible to restore the commons.


#### Our tools to achieve above
