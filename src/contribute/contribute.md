This book is being co-created on a github repository:

- [https://github.com/despiegk/book_earth_regenerator](https://github.com/despiegk/book_earth_regenerator)

It has been created in the following way

- Voice recording
- Transcription with a tool called Descript
- Fixing the transcript
- Training an AI system on a writing style
- Feeding parts of each transcription and fixing them
- Generating images with ImageJourney, though some skill is required to get it going (-:)

It was amazing to see how far we got though in a short time.

The source of all of this is on [a google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kIX8Gq2oPaQ6u9OqWkNxVLHdVfc9HSTP?usp=sharing). It include the original voice recordings.

> This book is written in a very dense form like source code, there are lots of concepts in side which will need more expansion. The book might be hard to read as such.
